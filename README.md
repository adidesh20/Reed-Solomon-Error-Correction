# Error Correction using Reed-Solomon Codes

Reed-Solomon codes are a group of error-correcting codes (ECC) which have been used for data redundancy in numerous technologies, including CDs, DVDs, and QR Codes. 

This project was completed as Coursework 3 for the Fourth Year module ELEC97013 Coding Theory at Imperial College London. It contains two implementations of Reed-Solomon codes; first using only integer Galois Finite Fields, and secondly using more general Galois Fields which allow for polynomial coefficients. All implementations are coded in Julia.
